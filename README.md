Sablier uses this GitHub Pages site to host various files, such as the Sablier logo, chain and token icons, the Terms of
Service, and the Privacy Policy.

## Domain

The canonical domain name for this site is `files.sablier.com`, but you can also access it via `sablier-labs.github.io`.

## Jekyll

GitHub Pages uses Jekyll for building websites from repository contents. By default, Jekyll excludes certain files from
the build process, such as files and folders that start with a dot (`.`) or an underscore (`_`).

For guidance on how to exclude more files, see my
[conversation with ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/ebb35efe-114f-4924-a15e-d68db3733163).

## Branding Notice

For branding assets to be used in marketing materials head over to the
